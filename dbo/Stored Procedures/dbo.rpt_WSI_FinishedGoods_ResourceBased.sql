Assumptions:
1) Any inventory account is mapped to Ifrs concepts: Inventories, NonCurrentinventories, or their descendants
2) All entries use a raw material resource. For balance migration, we need to add for every inventory account
	a resource called non-specified (for that account), and migrate balances to it.
