/*
	The following code takes a hierarchy table and reassigns the value to the nodes so that it looks
	as if it was filled from scratch. It is similar to organizing an index that has undergone lots of 
	fragmentation due to deletions and insertions.
	It may be useful to run before inserting a huge number of nodes in an already fragmented tree, 
	assuming we have an optimal recusrive code for this insertion.
