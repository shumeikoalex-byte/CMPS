We may go further down by identifying activities in a business unit, and allocate expenses to those, for more accurate cost accounting
Budgets table: Id, Business unit, Direction, Account, Resource, ValueMeasure, Value, Period
Produced: Business Unit (sales), Direction (Debit), Account (FG inventory), Resource ...
Sold: Business Unit (sales), Direction (Debit), Account (Revenues), Resource ...
